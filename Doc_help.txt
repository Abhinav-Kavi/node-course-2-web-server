Serving directories

- We can use a middleware to configure how our express app.
- there are some built in middleware present and also we can create our own middleware
- We will use express.static("absoulte path of directory we want to server") which gives us a middleware to serve directories.
- we will use use(middleware) to use that middleware.
-  __dirname = gives the absolute path of our current dir

 Templates

-We can serve an html to user in 3 ways
 -serve a directory containing html files
 -return an html inside res.send("<h1>  </h1>")
 -create a template and render it.

Templates define a way to create reusable pieces of html which can take values on the fly and generate a custom html

Handlebars.js - is a library that helps us define Templates
hbs - it is a node js module that uses Handlebars.js internally and exposes its methods
hbs will serve as a view engine for our app. We will set the view engine using set()

By default express uses a "views" directory for its template files

Middleware

A middleware is a piece of code that changes the way the express handles your request. 
It can contain any functionality that you want to add when a request is made, for eg:
 - request logging
 - authentication
 - response handling , etc

we need to "use" function to register a middleware.
A middleware function has 3 parameters
 req, res,next
next() is called when we want to move on to next middleware if any or move forward to process the request.
next() indicates that the middleware (calling next) has finished its functionality.

Note: Middleware are executed in the order of occurance in the source file.
